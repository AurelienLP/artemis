Artemis Next Generation
=====

Currently working with tests calling the function journey() only once. Only on one coverage (to choose in accordance with the tests).
If a test fails, a folder 'outputs' is created in artemis/artemis/ and reference and response are saved as a file, json format.
Also, if a test fails, differences between both files line per line are shown in the console.


How to use
=====

* launch jormun/tyr/artemis instances' docker containers:
    - to build jormun/tyr's containers, use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia-docker-compose/docker-compose.yml)
    - bo build artemis instances' containers, use [docker-artemis-instance.yml](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia-docker-compose/blob/master/artemis/docker-artemis-instance.yml)(you can also rebuild this file with a jinja template, which is explained in readme)
    - Once you set up all correctly, launch this command: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -f docker-artemis-instance.yml`

* In default_settings.py
    - set URL_JORMUN
    - set URL_TYR
    - set DATA_DIR (artemis data)
    - set REFERENCE_FILE_PATH(the path to artemis references)
    - set RESPONSE_FILE_PATH (Optional, output of the responses generated by artemis)

* In the X_test.py file, replace imports

`from artemis.test_mechanism import dataset, DataSet, set_scenario`

by

`from artemis.base_pytest import ArtemisTestFixture`

* Launch tests: `py.test artemis/tests`
    - If you don't want to call `cities`, add `--skip_cities`
    - If you want to show prints, you can also add this argument `-s`
